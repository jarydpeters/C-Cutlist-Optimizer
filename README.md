This C program takes is made to address the NP Hard problem of cutlist optimization, or 2D shape packing.

It takes in a stock length and a list of desired cuts along with their lengths and provides an optimized custlist to reduce number of needed stocks and waste.

Due to the nature of the problem, this program suffers greatly with larger cutlist sizes due to its O(n!) runtime.

The functionality of the program is enforced by a suite of unit tests.
